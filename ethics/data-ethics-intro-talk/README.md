- Have a data ethics panels using the three pronged approach (slide #8) - ethics of data, ethics of algorithms, ethics of practices - to generate questions 
- Using the three pronged approach (slide #8) - ethics of data, ethics of algorithms, ethics of practices - invite your group to find ethical challenges in the current moment and highlight what are the ethical challenges presented
- Invite a speaker to give a talk that is in this flavor! Need ideas whom to invite? Reach out via email (see below)!
